- Geospatial simulations involve the use of computer based models to simulate and analyze real world geographic phnomena.
## Data Integration:
- Geospatial simulations rely on integrating diverse data sources, including satellite imagery, terrain models, climate data and more.
## GIS Integration:
- Geographic Information System play a crucial in geospatial simulations.
## Simulation Models:
- Various types of models are employed in geospatial simulations, including physical models.
## Urban Planning and Design:
- Geospatial simulations aid urban planners in designing and optimizing cities.
- They can simulate the impact of new ifrastructure, zoning changes, or population growth on a city's layout and functionality.
